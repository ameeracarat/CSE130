# Assignment 1 directory

This directory contains source code and other files for Assignment 1.

Included is the file:

- memory.c

which takes in either a read or set command. Given the get command, it outputs the contents of the provided file into STDOUT. Given the set command, it writes in the provided content into the desired file.


I used pseudocode provided at Mitchell's section in order to read and write the bytes, and parse the command.

# Assignment 2 directory

This directory contains source code and other files for Assignment 2.

Included is the file:

- httpserver.c

which reads in a client's request from a socket and sends in a response accordingly. It supports two methods: GET and PUT, which either write out the contents of a file or write  the desired message into a file. I used the provided asgn2 x86 helper functions, which are  included. There is also a makefile included which I took from the resources repository.
